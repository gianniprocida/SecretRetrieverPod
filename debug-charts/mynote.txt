The approach you prefer is to explicitly mount volumes from Kubernetes secrets
 and make this process configurable. This means you want to give users, such as
  operators, the ability to specify which secrets should be mounted and where they 
  should be mounted when deploying a containerized application in Kubernetes. Here's a 
  breakdown of what this approach entails:

Explicit Volume Mounting: In Kubernetes, you can mount volumes, including secrets, 
into pods. This allows you to expose files from these volumes to containers running inside
 the pod. In your case, you want to mount secrets as volumes explicitly, so the data from
  these secrets becomes available as regular files within the containers.

Configurability: You want to make this process configurable, which means you want to allow
 users (e.g., operators) to specify which secrets should be mounted and where they should 
 be mounted. This configuration could be done through Helm values, which can be adjusted 
 at deployment time.
 
Dynamic Generation: To implement this configurability, you would create a Helm chart
 that takes a list of secrets and their mount paths as configuration inputs.
  Then, within your Helm templates, you would dynamically generate the necessary 
  Kubernetes resource definitions (e.g., volumes and volume mounts) based on the
   values provided in the Helm chart's values.yaml.
